# Flora datasets
ðŸŒ±ðŸŒ³ Flora datasets is a curated list of datasets on plants, trees and forests to help the flora-interested AI community develop models.

Plants and forests are essential for our planet and for humanity. They produce oxygen, help regulate the climate, provide habitats for wildlife, protect water resources, prevent soil erosion, and provide us resources and medicine.
However, they are threatened by diseases, deforestation, climate change, wildfires, invasive species, pollution, and overharvesting. For our planet and for the sake of our own survival, we must protect them.

AI will play a crucial role in safeguarding plant life and forests, notably by enabling efficient monitoring, detection of threats like deforestation and wildfires, species identification, diseases identification or the development of new methods for sustainable forest management. But to develop these technologies, we first need data!
